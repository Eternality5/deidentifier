      "description": "The following questions are relating to finding if the persecutor risk is applicable to the dataset. A persecutor risk is when the a person (the persecutor) is trying to identify specific individual that they know is in the dataset. The persecutor already has information about the person they are attempting to identify.",
      "help_tip": "If one of the following question is marked as true the dataset contains a persecutor risk. If there is a persecutor risk this needs to be managed and stricter recommendation will be given. The following article recommends using K-Anonymity when a persecutor threat is present, the disadvantage of this is it reduces the utility otherwise if no threat is present we will use a k-map instead, if possible.",
