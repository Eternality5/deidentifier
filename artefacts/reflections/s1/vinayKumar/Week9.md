## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
- Re-created the front-end using figma according to the new requirements.
- Get feedback on requirements form the client in the next meeting

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
- We were not sure about the technology selection for the project due to changes in requirement.
- We had to change our approach for the framework, as we will not be using actual dataset for de-identification decision support framework.
