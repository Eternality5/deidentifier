# Week 12 Reflection
*Maximilien Schuller â€“ a1766887*

## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
This week I worked on the presentation plan, presentation, de-identification report, edits to the de-identification questions, and created some issues of the GitHub. Needless to say this was a busy week. 
For the presentation plan I did some of it in the previous week but I finalised the plan with Vinay this week and got the workload for the presention distibuted in a meeting on Wednesday.

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
Next week I plan to work on the final report which is due next Sunday. In terms of specific parts of the report I will be working on, I am unsure but the marco level tasks are as follows:
- Firstly I will create a plan for the report as I had done for the presentation. My team mate noted that the plan for the presentation has been very helpful and I hope that it will provide similar guidance for the report. 
- Secondly I will have a meeting to distribute the workload of the assignment. 
- Thirdly I will complete my assigned section of the final report. 

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
The presentation plan took longer than expected to be approved. The deadline for the plan was supposed to be the 30th of May but it was push back by one day. This was on account of a few different factors including changes needing to be made to the plan in the meeting on the 30th and my own poor plannning that meant the meeting needed to be cut short, because I had forgotten about a club commitment. Ultimately the plan was confirmed in a meeting on the 31st before which requested changes were made to the plan and a draft of the workload completed online.
