# Week 13 Reflection
*Maximilien Schuller â€“ a1766887*

## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
This past week after doing the final presentation, I have been working on the final report. I finished the plan for the report with the work distribution early in the week. The sections of the report I am responsible for are the project specification, the implementation, the division of work, and I have made contributions to the appendicies in the form of the Gantt Chart, Kanban Board, and team meetings record.

In addition to these tasks, I have been trying to ensure that the repository will be in a good state to submit on this evening.

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
I probably will not work on the project in the coming week, as the semester has finished. During the break I plan to set up all the technologies we stated we would work with in the report, including CI/CD. I will need to create a new timeline for the project as the inital prototype timeline has now finished.

## List the issues you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
- Running out of time for the final report, there is quite a short time frame between the presentation and the report, we focused heavily on the presentation and the rubric indicated that the content of the presentation should be very different to the report. Another group said they based their presentation off the report they had already witten but I didn't think that was the correct approach for my group.
- Staying under the page limit. This morning the page count was 22 pages, and this afternoon the page count is 19 pages, excluding 6 pages which are not the main part of the report it is 13 pages long. The limit is 12. We were told this would probably be fine though.
