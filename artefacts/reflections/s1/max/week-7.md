# Week 7 Reflection
*Maximilien Schuller â€“ a1766887*

## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
This reflection includes the holidays so it is technically three weeks of work.
I have done the following issues:
- Set up the Java Spring boot back-end
- Implemented a contiuous integration pipleine for spring boot
- Worked on uploading data sets a json files (But not completed to a standard I would like)
- Added MongDB to the project
- And created most of the CRUD routes for research datasets

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
- I need to fix the ARX dependency becasue I did not add it correctly and have never added local dependencies before
- Create the CRUD endponts for de-identification configuration

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
- I had some issues setting up spring boot and IntelliJ, the IDE could not find the external dependencies so it was causing the debuger to not work, this is fixed now, it was somthing to do with the source route.
- I forgot how dependency injection works with spring boot, so my tests weren't working, they are working now.
