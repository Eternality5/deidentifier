# Week 10 Reflection
*Maximilien Schuller â€“ a1766887*

## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
I have continued to work on the de-identification question set, I have create four catagoires, including column information, persecuter risk, current de-identification, and extra section about determining if the user has missed any potential quazi-identifiers in their dataset. I was happy to hear that we had been given an extra week before the next client meeting as we need more time to work on the questions, Figma prototype, and slides to present in the meeting.

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
I plan submit and have reviewed a first draft of the de-identification questions, I'll submit a pull request for the questions. I hope to have the questions reviewed in the client meeting and we can uses their comments to create a second draft of the questions.

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
I have not encountered that many issues this week, just as I said in the first question we have a lot of work to do and not very much time.
Small group. There are only two of us and I think this limits my ability to take on a propper role in the group. I would like to be able to dedicate more of my time to being the project manager but there are other important jobs that need to be done.
