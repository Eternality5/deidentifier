# Week 11 Reflection
*Maximilien Schuller â€“ a1766887*

## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
Throughout this week, I made the following contribution to the project. I enhanced the de-identification questions by organizing them into logical groups, addressing spelling issues, and creating a pull request. 
I reviewed the project's requirements, removing irrelevant ones and amending partially correct clauses. I communicated these changes to the client in the meeting on Thursday. I also uploaded the requirements artefacts on GitHub for review from my group partner.
Additionally, I prepared the following power point slide, agenda, requirement changes, de-identification questions, and the current plan. 
Lastly, I maintained the project's GitHub repository by removing irrelevant issues to ensure its accuracy.

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
Next week, my individual plan for the project involves two main tasks. Firstly, I will create a presentation plan for the upcoming presentation, which is scheduled for June 5th. Secondly, I will start implementing the plan by preparing the slides and necessary materials for the final presentation.

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
Throughout week 11 I came across a few challenges. Firstly, I faced a heavy workload in other subjects, including the need to prepare for my research methods in software engineering presentation. This limited the time I could allocate to the project. Secondly, I realized that the editor I used for the de-identification questions lacked a spell check feature, leading to some spelling errors in the question set. However, I didn't encounter many major issues this week since most tasks were straightforward and manageable.
