*Maximilien Schuller â€“ a1766887*

## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
This week I have been working on reviewing papers and creating de-identification question. 
I have gathered a list of potential topics catagories of questions that I could make and identified papers that relate to these catagories.

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
I plan to start drafting the actual questions, and question groups as this week has mosly been identifying papers and using them to identify the groups of questions that should be added.

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
- Writing good de-identification question, a lot of the information I would like to get from the user requires them to have knowledge about complicated topics such as k-annonimity. I need to make the questions understandable to the user.
