# Week 5 Refelction
## What have you done for the project during the week individually?
This week I have been working on implementing the question pages for the questionaiore.

## What you plan to do for the project next week individually?
For these two week I have tried to do as much as I can in the first week as I won't have as much time next week due to a lot of other assignments. Next week I will try to do some project management stuff for the projec such as organising what should be worked on in the coming sprints.

## List the issue you encounter and give reasons if applicable.
I've encountered a few issues:
Vinay has been sick which has delayed us having a meeting to discuss what needs to be worked on, in our meeting last week with the client, we had to change our objective for the week.
I've had some issues with Django, in particular with building forms as I need to create a form that submits mutiple objects from the same class.
I have also had an issue, when I click next page it loads the entire page its div. I haven't been able to figure out why it is doing that, it should just load in a partial.
